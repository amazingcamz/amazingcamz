Expert in application support analysis with more than four years of experience in the field.
7 months experience as Information System Support. During those years I have learned the many forms of technical and application aspects.
My recent and previous experience gave me the ability to commit to providing a pleasant experience for business application users.
Able to keep a level head even when a problem is more difficult than initially expected, and gave me the capability to commit extra work and improve my multitasking skill.

Sometimes, I acted as a user tester for the newly created and developed or enhanced application before the deployment to production. 
It was tested in every scenario to see possible bugs or errors. Ensured the application worked as expected before promotion to production.

In my spare time, you'll find me spending quality time with my family and child. Sometimes playing sports like badminton is my favorite.
I am interested in assisting people and I love the satisfaction that comes from helping them.
